A simple Flutter App structure where the students need to code and make a simple ui as per there choice.
The android folder contains all the android related files.
The iOS folder contains all the iOS related files.
Dont make any changes in the above two folders.
The lib folder is the main folder where you will actually have to code. It consists a main.dart file which include the basic required packages along with a basic line of code. You just need to code in the container fuction and make a beautiful ui for any app of your choice.
The pubspec.yaml file is where you need to include all the external packages, fonts, assets etc. if you are using any in your app other than the default ones.
